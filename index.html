<h1><strong>DH199 Project: Sharing the Meaning of Music</strong></h1>
<hr>
<h2>Design Statement</h2>
<p>Music listeners need a way to feel emotionally connected to others through their shared experiences and memories with music in their lives because there are limits with music listening services on the user experience for engaging in shared memory and meaning of music.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div>
<p>
This study explores the relationship between music, human emotions, and memory. Music plays a prominent role in everyday life for many people (Jäncke, 2008). People listen to music throughout the day through technologies such as radio and audio recordings. Music takes many 
forms throughout people’s daily lives: music as part of collective cultural memory and identity, music as a method of creating a sense of belonging, and music as a connection between an individual to a larger community and generation (Dijck, 2006). Studies have shown that 
there is an association between memories and emotions to form autobiographical memories. One study examined the emotions that are evoked when hearing musical pieces from one’s past. The study found that most songs evoked various strong emotions, which were mainly positive 
such as nostalgia (Jäncke, 2008).
</p>

<p>
Music streaming services today have community features, such as sharing, for users to actively engage with the community through the shared interest in music. Some examples of this are sharing a playlist of songs with a friend or leaving a comment on a song. However, these
community features vary across different apps, thus limiting how deep individuals become engaged with the community. Taking into account the strengths and limitations of current music streaming apps, the project will aim towards creating an app that focuses on enhancing 
community features where individuals can share their emotions, memories, or experiences with music in their lives with others in the community.

<h2>Literature Review</h2>
<div>
<p>
Music is strongly intertwined with memories, being attached to events of the past, accompanied by sights, sounds, and feelings from a specific event. A cognitive research study examining the ties between music, memories of autobiographical events, and emotions found that 
young adults tie in recorded music with memories of specific autobiographical events, whereas respondents who indicated an age over 45 tend to tie specific songs to nostalgic moods (Dijck, 2006). Another study confirmed these observations about the relationship between 
musical memory and emotions, arguing that music evokes memories of youth and reminds people of past events, thus intensifying feelings of nostalgia, regret, or reminiscence (Dijck, 2006). 
</p>

<p>
Autobiographical memories exist in different levels of detail. The broader level of detail describes it as periods in one’s lifetime. The finer level of specificity is knowledge of specific events (Janata et al., 2007). When thinking about autobiographical memories for 
music, one way to think about it is the retrieval of information about the music, such as the title of the song, the artist, or the time period it was popular. However, without these pieces of information, we can still relive the memories and emotions tied with a piece 
of music just by listening to it. In many cases, the music piece becomes stored in memory during an event without the need of knowing the song’s title. In a study focusing on the characteristics of autobiographical memories evoked by music, it was observed from written 
responses that there was a large range of memories associated with music. Some descriptions are of specific events that happened in association with the music, such as waiting at a red light in the car with a high school friend. Other descriptions tied music to social 
relationships, such as friends or significant others. There are also responses where the participant tied different songs to specific moments in their life, such as stages of a romantic relationship while they were young (Janata et al., 2007). The different levels of 
specificity tied to the memory of a song varies across individuals, but a common theme is that the music means something to the individual, whether trivial or not.
</p>

<p>
Technological advancements have led to the ability to preserve and archive music in physical and digital formats. Music streaming apps today are an ever-growing archive of music from around the world. It acts as an archive of music from the past, but also continues 
growing for music constantly being created in the present. Due to the continuous growth of music, apps are caught between their own purpose in the app’s design and the desires of the user. Keeping in mind the complex ties between music, memory, and human emotions, users 
may tend to feel drawn towards finding music from their past, while the app is designed to push users toward exploring music. A case study on Spotify by Marika Lüders in the European Journal of Cultural Studies focuses on defining what Spotify ‘wants’ and what humans 
want. The study characterizes Spotify’s features into two categories: material and machine agency. Machine agency features include recommendation algorithms. Material features include browsing music, connecting with friends, editing playlists, and saving albums and 
artists. The purpose of pushing people towards exploring music is done through the machine agency, whereas the personal and mnemonic meaning of music is supported by material features (Lüders, 2021).
</p>

<p>
The study interviewed participants on their experiences with different features of Spotify. Participants found the accessibility to vast music libraries made them more inclined to explore and discover music. However, being able to access and explore a vast amount of 
music leads to ephemeral listening-patterns, where users described themselves losing focus to finish listening to an album and jumping quickly between songs. One user compared the experience of buying a CD and listening to it in a certain setting in contrast with being 
able to pick songs at random on music streaming services. They explained how the short-attention span with listening to music makes it difficult to associate songs or albums with certain occasions or memories. This indicates the design to explore in Spotify may be leading 
to a loss in the sentiments of associating memories with music (Lüders, 2021). Actions that counteract this design is the user’s will to archive. The feature of creating playlists acts as a primary instrument for users to archive music that matters to them. It is akin to 
the physical act of collecting CDs and other physical music recordings.
</p>

<p>
By documenting the role of music in human memories and emotions and the potential limitations of community-related features of current music streaming services, this project is aimed to develop a user experience that engages music more closely with the autobiographical 
memories and emotions of individuals and introducing useful features to bring individuals closer together through the shared experiences of listening to music.

<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
<div>
<p>
Before working on a design, I first examined popular music streaming apps to understand what services many people use to listen to music. This competitive analysis serves as a method to help me understand the design of the most widely used music streaming services. 
The rankings of the top 5 music streaming apps are ranked on total number of users and paid subscribers from 2023 statistics summarized on BusinessofApps database overview for “Music Streaming App Revenue and Usage Statistics (2023)”. The remaining 2 apps were chosen 
based on features that focused on the experience of sharing music with others. It was difficult to pinpoint apps that largely focused on community features for music due to the many mainstream music listening services across the globe. By choosing apps from the popular 
end of the spectrum to the niche side, a cross comparison analysis can be conducted.
