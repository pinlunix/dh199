  <h1><strong>DH199 Project: Sharing the Meaning of Music</strong></h1>
  <hr>
  <h2>Design Statement</h2>
    <p>Music listeners need a way to feel emotionally connected to others through their shared experiences and memories with music in their lives
      because there are limits with music listening services on the user experience for engaging in shared memory and meaning of music.
    </p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
    This study explores the relationship between music, human emotions, and memory. Music plays a prominent role in everyday life for many people (Jäncke, 2008). 
    People listen to music throughout the day through technologies such as radio and audio recordings. Music takes many forms throughout people’s daily lives: 
    music as part of collective cultural memory and identity, music as a method of creating a sense of belonging, and music as a connection between an individual 
    to a larger community and generation (Dijck, 2006). Studies have shown that there is an association between memories and emotions to form autobiographical 
    memories. One study examined the emotions that are evoked when hearing musical pieces from one’s past. The study found that most songs evoked various strong 
    emotions, which were mainly positive such as nostalgia (Jäncke, 2008).
    </p>

    <p>
    Music streaming services today have community features, such as sharing, for users to actively engage with the community through the shared interest in music. 
    Some examples of this are sharing a playlist of songs with a friend or leaving a comment on a song. However, these community features vary across different apps, 
    thus limiting how deep individuals become engaged with the community. Taking into account the strengths and limitations of current music streaming apps, the 
    project will aim towards creating an app that focuses on enhancing community features where individuals can share their emotions, memories, or experiences with 
    music in their lives with others in the community.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Literature Review</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
    Music is strongly intertwined with memories, being attached to events of the past, accompanied by sights, sounds, and feelings from a specific event. A cognitive 
    research study examining the ties between music, memories of autobiographical events, and emotions found that young adults tie in recorded music with memories of 
    specific autobiographical events, whereas respondents who indicated an age over 45 tend to tie specific songs to nostalgic moods (Dijck, 2006). Another study 
    confirmed these observations about the relationship between musical memory and emotions, arguing that music evokes memories of youth and reminds people of past 
    events, thus intensifying feelings of nostalgia, regret, or reminiscence (Dijck, 2006). 
    </p>

    <p>
    Autobiographical memories exist in different levels of detail. The broader level of detail describes it as periods in one’s lifetime. The finer level of 
    specificity is knowledge of specific events (Janata et al., 2007). When thinking about autobiographical memories for music, one way to think about it is the 
    retrieval of information about the music, such as the title of the song, the artist, or the time period it was popular. However, without these pieces of information, 
    we can still relive the memories and emotions tied with a piece of music just by listening to it. In many cases, the music piece becomes stored in memory during 
    an event without the need of knowing the song’s title. In a study focusing on the characteristics of autobiographical memories evoked by music, it was observed 
    from written responses that there was a large range of memories associated with music. Some descriptions are of specific events that happened in association with 
    the music, such as waiting at a red light in the car with a high school friend. Other descriptions tied music to social relationships, such as friends or significant 
    others. There are also responses where the participant tied different songs to specific moments in their life, such as stages of a romantic relationship while they 
    were young (Janata et al., 2007). The different levels of specificity tied to the memory of a song varies across individuals, but a common theme is that the music 
    means something to the individual, whether trivial or not.
    </p>

    <p>
    Technological advancements have led to the ability to preserve and archive music in physical and digital formats. Music streaming apps today are an ever-growing 
    archive of music from around the world. It acts as an archive of music from the past, but also continues growing for music constantly being created in the present. 
    Due to the continuous growth of music, apps are caught between their own purpose in the app’s design and the desires of the user. Keeping in mind the complex ties 
    between music, memory, and human emotions, users may tend to feel drawn towards finding music from their past, while the app is designed to push users toward 
    exploring music. A case study on Spotify by Marika Lüders in the European Journal of Cultural Studies focuses on defining what Spotify ‘wants’ and what humans 
    want. The study characterizes Spotify’s features into two categories: material and machine agency. Machine agency features include recommendation algorithms. 
    Material features include browsing music, connecting with friends, editing playlists, and saving albums and artists. The purpose of pushing people towards exploring 
    music is done through the machine agency, whereas the personal and mnemonic meaning of music is supported by material features (Lüders, 2021).
    </p>

    <p>
    The study interviewed participants on their experiences with different features of Spotify. Participants found the accessibility to vast music libraries made them 
    more inclined to explore and discover music. However, being able to access and explore a vast amount of music leads to ephemeral listening-patterns, where users 
    described themselves losing focus to finish listening to an album and jumping quickly between songs. One user compared the experience of buying a CD and listening 
    to it in a certain setting in contrast with being able to pick songs at random on music streaming services. They explained how the short-attention span with 
    listening to music makes it difficult to associate songs or albums with certain occasions or memories. This indicates the design to explore in Spotify may be leading 
    to a loss in the sentiments of associating memories with music (Lüders, 2021). Actions that counteract this design is the user’s will to archive. The feature of 
    creating playlists acts as a primary instrument for users to archive music that matters to them. It is akin to the physical act of collecting CDs and other physical 
    music recordings.
    </p>

    <p>
    By documenting the role of music in human memories and emotions and the potential limitations of community-related features of current music streaming services, 
    this project is aimed to develop a user experience that engages music more closely with the autobiographical memories and emotions of individuals and introducing 
    useful features to bring individuals closer together through the shared experiences of listening to music.

  <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      I examined popular music streaming apps to understand what services many people use to listen to music. This competitive analysis serves as a method to help me 
      understand the design of the most widely used music streaming services. The rankings of the top 5 music streaming apps are ranked on total number of users and 
      paid subscribers from 2023 statistics summarized on BusinessofApps database overview for “Music Streaming App Revenue and Usage Statistics (2023)”. I chose two 
      other apps based on features focused on the experience of sharing music with others. By choosing apps from the popular end of the spectrum to the niche side, 
      a cross comparison analysis can be conducted.

  <h2>User Research</h2>

    <h3>Secondary Sources</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        For part of my user research, I analyzed data collected by two studies that have interviewed and surveyed people about their experiences with music. 
        The studies I analyze data from are “Record and Hold: Popular Music between Personal and Collective Memory” by Dijck and “Pushing music: People’s 
        continued will to archive versus Spotify’s will to make them explore” by Lüders. Analyzing digital records will provide an overview of the music 
        experience from a music listener’s perspective while interview data will provide in-depth understanding of what participants think about specific 
        aspects of the music listening experience and reveal common keywords in regards to these experiences.
      </p>
      <h4>Dutch Top 2000 Narrative Responses</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          In Dijck’s study “Record and Hold: Popular Music between Personal and Collective Memory”, Dijck analyzed an online set of narrative responses 
          generated through the Dutch Top 2000, a national radio-event. This radio event organizes a five-day broadcast of the 2000 most popular songs of 
          all times, compiled by public radio listeners. During the event, the station asks for personal comments from listeners, which involve evaluations 
          and memories of the songs. The comments range from in the moment, physical experiences to reminiscing on past memories.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many comments that Dijk quotes in this study. I drew the following keywords to categorize the various types of comments: technology, 
          mood, memory, family, and collective. Below is a table that ties quotes from comments that fit these keywords.

      <h4>User Experience with Spotify</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          Lüders’ “Pushing music: People’s continued will to archive versus Spotify’s will to make them explore” is a case study on the user experience for 
          the music streaming service app Spotify. The study conducted interviews to examine how people express their needs for exploring and archiving music.
        </p>
        <p>
          For exploring music, a recurring theme among participants is the easy access to vast music libraries. This made them more inclined to exploring 
          and discovering music. One participant described how Spotify encouraged them to become more open to music they would not have listened to in the past. 
          The second way participants explore music in Spotify is by seeing what their friends are listening to by looking at the friend feeds feature in the app. 
          The third way of exploring music is through the recommendation algorithm. The recommendation algorithm similarly helped some participants open up 
          their tastes in music genres.
        </p>
        <p>
          For archiving music, many participants felt that Spotify’s features for saving and collecting music was inferior to physical collections or digital 
          collections of music as local files. The participants expressed that saving music involved the user knowing about the feature and actively using the 
          feature to save music. One participant expressed that they have to actively remind themselves to remember the artist they just listened to before they 
          move on to listening to other artists. Another participant preferred the nostalgia of having their own material collections of their favorite artists 
          and albums on their iPhone and physical CDs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spotify does offer the function to create playlists, which users use as a means to save music. Participants’ reasons for creating playlists go beyond 
          just creating a digital archive. Participants want to remember certain phases of their life or express a particular mood. One participant explained that 
          they used playlists as a way to link personal meanings in their life to music: “when I was 14, that was the time I loved hip-hop.” Another participant 
          created multiple playlists for different moods and environments: “I have several work-playlists that I have in the background while working.”

    <h3>User Interviews</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        After analyzing secondary sources to understand a sample of the population’s relationship with music, I conducted interviews with two people. 
        My interview questions were focused on understanding the past and present relationships between the participants and music.
      </p>
      <h4>Interview 1</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          My first participant is someone in the elderly age group above 60 years.
          <ol>
            <li>Do you think music has an important role in your life? Explain?
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The participant thought that music plays a major role in his life. He listens to music everywhere he goes while performing various 
                  activities such as driving, walking, and biking. He regarded music as a form of pleasure and relaxation.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What kind of music do you listen to?
              <ul>
                <li>
                  He enjoys listening to 50s rock & roll. When it comes to listening to music on the radio, he prefers tuning into oldies stations. 
                  When it comes to the CDs he owns, he likes 60s and 70s rock music.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Do you have a special memory related to music?
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The participant laughed and remembered the hit song “Wake Up Maggie” by Rod Stewart back in the early 70s. He associated the song with 
                  the event of him going to college for the first time.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>How did you listen to music when you were younger?
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In his teens, everyone used record players to listen to music. He and his friends would buy 45 RPM records and bring them around. 
                  In his early teens, he would go to parties or visit a friend’s home and bring a stack of 45s to play music. In his later teens, the 
                  Beatles just came out and were very popular. He and his friends bought their records and would go over to a friend’s house to closely 
                  analyze the music and try to figure out the lyrics.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>How do you listen to music today?
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The participant currently uses Apple Music to collect and listen to music. He explained that if there is a song he likes, he would like 
                  the song and add it to his song library.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Is there anything about listening to music today that you miss from the past?
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The participant did not feel dissatisfied with his music listening experience in the current day. The only thing he misses about the past 
                  is being young.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>Interview 2</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          The second participant is in the middle-aged group below 60 years.
          <ol>
            <li>Do you think music has an important role in your life? Explain?
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The participant thought music was important in their life. She thinks of music as a way to relax and as an outlet for emotions.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What kind of music do you listen to?
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The participant has no preference in what music she enjoys listening to. She instead keeps up with current music trends.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Do you have a special memory related to music?
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The participant recalled a distant memory from her youth. The participant was raised in Taiwan and recalled when she would 
                  accompany her mother to listen to music. Her mother preferred listening to Chinese music that was created during the WWII era. 
                  The participant also described how the singers would wear traditional clothing called qipao and had a cautious posture on stage 
                  unlike today where singers actively perform on stage.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>How did you listen to music when you were younger?
              <ul>
                <li>
                  She mainly mentioned the radio. Vinyls were not as popular where she was because the machine used to listen to vinyl was expensive. 
                  She explained that music was played on a radio in public places. Thus, everyone could listen to the music together. She also mentioned 
                  a special radio that could play tapes. If either her or her friends had certain tapes, they would meet up to play the songs together on the radio.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>How do you listen to music today?
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The participant currently uses the Spotify app and the internet to search for and listen to music. She explained that she sometimes uses 
                  YouTube to first search for old songs that she may or may not be familiar with, then find them again on the Spotify app to listen to.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Is there anything about listening to music today that you miss from the past?
              <ul>
                <li>
                  She expressed that she is satisfied with listening to music on apps today. The participant also mentioned that the experience of listening 
                  to music changes over time. She explained that in the past, music was a more shared experience where she used a radio to listen to music with 
                  a group of friends. In comparison, today she can enjoy music in private.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

    </div>
    <h3>Analysis of User Research</h3>
    <div>
      <h4>Secondary Sources Analysis</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          Analyzing the quotes collected from the Dutch Top 2000 in Dijk’s study, I categorized overarching themes as keywords based on the context of 
          the comments: mood, memory, technology, family, and collective. I found that these keywords often overlap with each other because memories are 
          complex and can contain the other keywords within it. For example: one comment encompassed a memory of listening to music with friends with 
          iPods in the car. By recognizing these keywords as well as how they overlap, I got information about how to execute features to allow users 
          of my app to express their memories with music.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the case study on user experiences with the Spotify app, I learned what users liked about the app and what they thought was lacking in 
          their listening experience with the app. Materially, users can archive and save their favorite music to return to later. Emotionally, users 
          create playlists to record memories, reflect emotions, or express phases in their life. By understanding how users feel about playlists, 
          I can develop a way to enhance the experience of creating playlists to the users of my app.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>User Interviews Analysis</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          I learned from these interviews that there is a special difference between the experiences of listening to music in a group compared to in private. 
          In a group, the experience is remembered as a fond memory involving friends and the technology used during that time. Individually, the experience 
          is more personal, involving daily life routines or reflecting one’s mood. By understanding these differences in music experiences, I can develop 
          a better understanding of the user personas I will create that will use my app.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>User Personas</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      I created three user personas to represent the users I intend to target with the app I will create. Below is one of the three personas.
